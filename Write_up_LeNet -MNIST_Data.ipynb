    "### Input\n",
    "The LeNet architecture accepts a 32x32xC image as input, where C is the number of color channels. Since MNIST images are grayscale, C is 1 in this case.\n",

    "### Architecture\n",
    "**Layer 1: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 28x28x6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pooling.** The output shape should be 14x14x6.\n",

    "**Layer 2: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 10x10x16.\n",

    "**Activation.** Your choice of activation function.\n",

    "**Pooling.** The output shape should be 5x5x16.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flatten.** Flatten the output shape of the final pooling layer such that it's 1D instead of 3D. The easiest way to do is by using `tf.contrib.layers.flatten`, which is already imported for you.\n",
